# CS 210 : Data Management in Data Science Course Project Guidelines
General Instruction
You should work on a project that is related to the theme of the course: data management
in data science. The scope of data management is broadly defined and can include any
aspect of data collection, storage, integration, transformation, analysis, and visualization. I
encourage you to pick a problem you are excited about and will be flexible if the project is
relevant to topics and research papers in lectures.
Group Formation and Submit the Project Topic -
You can form a project group (of max 3 people) and decide/submit the project topic by Nov
13th

Project Guidelines:
Components: Your project should cover all 3 components : Data Science, ML and Data base
( SQL) components.

Project - Formulate your own project question related to data management in data science
and attempt to provide a solution, which can be partial/complete with preliminary results.
Your project can be computational, theoretical, experimental, or empirical. A project can be
done individually (not recommended) or by a group of max 3 students (recommended, but
no more than 3).

Extra Notes:
- Start Early: Start thinking about your project early and spend enough time developing it.

Deliverables

1. Project Proposal
Due: 23:59pm, Nov13th, 2024 (encouraged to submit early)

Purpose: The written proposal should define your project/research question and explain
what you are planning to do.

Length: 2 pages (no more than 3), typed, single-space.

Content:
- Define Project: What problem are you solving? What strategic aspects are involved? How
does your project relate to the lectures/papers we discussed?
- Novelty and Importance: Why is your project important? Why are you excited about it?
What are some existing issues in current data management practices? Are there any prior
related works? Provide a brief summary.
- Plan: Be specific and succinct.
 - What kind of data will you use (if any)? How will you get it?
 Will you create or simulate it?
 - What models/techniques/algorithms do you plan to use or develop?
 - What would be your implementation steps? How will you evaluate your method?
 How will you test and measure success?

2. Final Report
Due: 23:59pm, Dec 9th, 2024

Length: Normally, a well-explained project would take 6-8 pages, typed, single-space.

Content:
- Project Definition:
 - What problem are you solving? What strategic aspects are involved? How does your
project relate to the lectures/papers we discussed?
 - Novelty and Importance:
 - Why is your project important? Why are you excited about it? What are some existing
issues in current data management practices? Are there any prior related works? Provide a
brief summary.
 - Depending on your individual case, the above two aspects can be an extended or revised
version of what you have written in your proposal.
- Progress and Contribution:
 - What kind of data did you use (if any)? How did you get it?
 - What models/techniques/algorithms did you use or develop?
 - What experiments did you design?
 - What are the key findings or results from your project? Did they verify or refute your original
hypothesis? How did you evaluate your method?
 - Discuss the advantages and limitations of your approach.
- Changes After Proposal:
 - If your final report differs from your proposed project, discuss the differences, why you
made certain changes, and the bottlenecks that prevented you from proceeding with the
proposed project.
